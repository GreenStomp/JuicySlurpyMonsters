How To Audio System With ScriptableObject Delegate Pattern.
Explaination:
With delegate pattern you can made an easy template SO and than create others SO that inherit from it.
The parent had only some abstract Method u whant in every son
(example: class Weapon have the Method Fireand Bazooka or machineGun too, so we made another class called 
MachineGun that inherit from weapon, override the method and implementig peculiar stuffs only machineGun have...
Like FireRate or for bazooka BlastRadius and so on...).

AudioManager: 
1) Class AudioEvent that inherit from  ScriptableObject(without the attribute createAssetsMenu on it
because we want the sons to be created, this is only the standard template others need to follow)
2) class SimpleAudioEvent that inherit from AudioEvent(with the attribute createAssetsMenu on it so we can
easily create this object whenever we want from create quick menu)

SimpleAudioEvent:
Here we have an audioclips array that un can fill with n clips, my script will pick u randomly a clip from
this array and play it in the audiosource we pass in the Play(AudioSource) method;

SimpleAudioEventEditor:
if u want to test your how the scripts works, under your simpleAudioEvent, in the Inspector you will have a button..
click on it when you had already setted your clips and see what happens.
